        "selftext": "Hello everyone,\n\nWe get a lot of mod mail about people's posts not showing up and I wanted to explain why.\n\nWe are very fortunate in a subreddit of our size to have limited reasons to moderate, as we are all united by our love of reading and you all do a good job of positively contributing to this community.  Thank you for that!\n\nOn the other hand, you might be surprised at how much spam we get from authors and bloggers, and by keeping our spam filters high it helps us to catch a lot of what gets posted.  You all do a great job of reporting the rest, and we appreciate you.\n\nDue to the spam filters and automod settings we have in place, some of your posts get temporarily filtered until we can review them.  Reddit recently created an automated message site-wide that creates a lot of confusion, saying your post has been removed.  PLEASE do not post again.  We aren't able to edit this message and we can't turn it off.  Your post hasn't been removed, it is just awaiting moderation.  If your post is removed by us, we will always give you a reason why and reference which rule has been violated.  If there isn't a reason, it was either removed by Reddit (you might be shadow banned and don't realize it) or it is in the moderation queue and will be actioned.  Either way, multiple posts won't help.\n\nThanks for understanding as we keep up with Reddit's changes.  We love this community and all of your passionate posts about books.  Keep reading and sharing, everyone!",

        "selftext": "Hello all,\n\n*(Message to the mods: this is a Meta post, please contact me if something is wrong!)*\n\n# The goodreads-bot Legacy\n\nAs you must know if you were already here last year, our beloved bot u/goodreadsbot stopped working in January after having been used **156.631** times on this subreddit by a total of **25.272** different users, because goodreads shut down API access.\n\nAs a bored nerd and fellow reader, I decided to start a new toy project: rise our bot back! But because the Goodreads API is now closed, the first task was to build my own Books database... which I did, using Reddit, Goodreads & Google Books.\n\nThis new bot called u/goodreads-rebot (\"bot\" + \"reboot\" = \"rebot\".....) is open source (link to source code below). I wanted to thank u/ArtyomR, the author of u/goodreadsbot, for the original idea. I am not u/ArtyomR, but I have great respect for his/her work and its legacy. Thank you!\n\n# How does it work? Just like before! (with more features)\n\nWrite `{{Harry Potter}} in your post` or alternatively `{{A Little Life by Hanya Yaniagara}} (notice the typo)` with a **\"by\"**  and the bot will answer with more information about the **book** or the **series**.\n\nThe search part is now part of the bot (and not on Goodreads API side), and was quite challenging to handle. **You definitely should specify the author with the \"by\" keyword**, because it helps the Database search. \n\n**Examples:**\n\n`You should read {{Harry Potter}} !` will work, it will recognize it as the name of a **Series**, in that case it will provide information about **the first book of the Series;**\n\n`My favorite book is {{Call Me By Your Name}}` will work too, the bot will try to find a book called **Call Me** by author named **Your Name** (because of the \"by\" keyword...) but it will fail to find one, so as a 2nd try because it's not *that* dumb, it will indeed find a book called **Call Me By Your Name** :)\n\n`Did you read {{1984 by Michael Radford}}?` (notice the wrong author): it will work too even if the author is wrong, because when the search fails using the author, it will try again ignoring it.\n\n# Features\n\nI added a \"Top 2 recommended-along\" section, featuring the 2 books that were the most recommended here on Reddit in the same threads than the book described. It is based on another toy project of mine (\ud83d\ude05), a book recommending algorithm I am working on, which is based on the co-occurences of book titles in Reddit threads. Let me know if you find this new information useful.\n\n# Limitations\n\nAs explained before, the bot is based on a book database I build and update as much as I can. The search will sometimes fail to match some existing books, in particular very niche books, or the recent ones. I am working on having the best and up-to-date database as possible, meanwhile sorry for the misses!\n\nAlso, the bot is currently not running on other subreddits (like r/booksuggestions), but because the code is really modular, it's just about configurations. FYI this is in the roadmap for the next few days/weeks.\n\nFinally, I may reach some rate posting limits because of low karma. Hopefully, this will be solved soon after some time thanks to your help :)\n\nYou will find below more information (links being forbidden in posts).\n\nI think that's it. \n\nSee you there!",

Next we read the first Boxcar Children book, and then read Wayside School is Falling Down.  We then started another Boxcar Children book, but he wanted to go back to Wayside, so we read the remaining 2.  Since finishing that series, we've tried Dogs Don't Tell Jokes (The only other Louis Sachar the library had at the time), one of the Stick Dog books, and Maniac Magee.  He keeps losing interest and asking if there are more Wayside books.\n\n  \nSo I need suggestions for books that he will find as funny and engaging as Wayside School, with the characters preferably being elementary-aged (I think this is why he didn't like Dogs Don't Tell Jokes, because they were middle-school aged).\n\n  \nThanks!",

Where they differ is that for orwell it was in an imagined worse case scenario society in which no free thinking is allowed in the public sphere. While Heller hints more at the complex (but still effective) political apparatus used to control public opinion in a \u201cdemocratic\u201d society with \u201cfreedom of speech\u201d (barring things like sedition, which is purposefully vague but especially useful tool in silencing war times dissenters). A society in which people would willingly give up their lives for a state, or accept the possibility of being drafted. \n\nOrwell\u2019s 1984 is a grisly and dystopian based largely on his hatred of Stalin. It was written by a very disillusioned, very ill man (he died shortly after it came out from tuberculosis) so anti-communist he was willing to snitch (provide a list of names to the UK government on any fellow writer he even thought may have been a communist (or someone who he perceived was susceptible to Russian blackmail eg gay people). Despite his major flaws, he was also one of the greatest political polemicists of the modern era. \n\nHis mindset according to his essay \u201cinside the whale\u201d written prior to 1984 was:\n\n> Almost certainly we are moving into an age of totalitarian dictatorships\u2014an age in which freedom of thought will be at first a deadly sin and later on a meaningless abstraction. The autonomous individual is going to be stamped out of existence.\n\n\nCatch 22 is a satire based on the reality of war, trying to navigate a purposefully incomprehensible bureaucracy, and the morality of killing other cogs because of the color of their coat for reasons that are truly beyond either cog\u2019s total comprehension (purposefully so - in the modern era in which expansionism & theft by plunder will not rally the people, the cause of war always differs from official government reasons). In the book, Heller said something akin to \u201cmy enemy isn\u2019t necessarily the opposing force, but whoever is trying to kill me.\u201d",

A disgraced knight, a priest whose flock has died, and a mysterious girl are looking for the Pope. Horrors both historic and supernatural stand in their way. \n\nManhunt by Gretchen Felker Martin. A virus has ripped through the North American continent and turned everyone whose testosterone levels are above a certain threshold into a dangerous feral monster.

Arranged marriages are common, since a high level purple might need Red or Blue genetics to keep the Purple line strong.\n\nIt's a quirky little dystopia and has enough social commentary and interesting world-building to generate discussion and conversation. Does participation in a corrupt system make you culpable? What sacrifices are appropriate? Is the spirit or letter of the law more important? Why is it illegal to manufacture spoons?\n\nHe has written a sequel, but the original is stand alone (and has done so for a while, since he took his time finishing the new one)",

Now the Chinese are ready to unveil their astonishing discovery within the greatest zoo ever constructed. A small group of VIPs and journalists has been brought to the zoo deep within China to see its fabulous creatures for the first time. Among them is Dr Cassandra Jane 'CJ' Cameron, a writer for NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC and an expert on reptiles. The visitors are assured by their Chinese hosts that they will marvel at these beasts, that they are perfectly safe, that nothing can go wrong . . .\n\n\n\nLeviathan James Byron Huggins\n\n\n\nOn an Icelandic Island, an illegal experiment intended to create the perfect biological weapon has transformed a once-innocent creature into the biblical Leviathan that once terrorized the world. Able to shatter steel and granite as easily as it can melt the strongest containment shields, Leviathan escapes from its pen and is loose in a vast underground chamber harboring soldiers and scientists.\n\n\n\nThe installation cannot allow Leviathan to reach the surface. For if Leviathan reaches the world, it could well be the end of the Earth. They must hold the line, here, and destroy it\u2026 even if they must detonate a last-chance nuclear failsafe built into the chamber itself. But, first, they must fight with every weapon at their disposal to discover if the beast can be killed at all.\n\n\n\nIt is a battle many will not survive.\n\n\n\nAs soldiers and scientists are vaporized by Leviathan\u2019s hellish flame, or ripped apart by the dragon\u2019s claws and fangs, a lone electrical engineer is forced to join the fight. And in the midst of what might well be the last battle for Mankind, Connor must find a way \u2013 any way \u2013 to save his family and kill this powerful, bloodthirsty Beast of Legend that has never been killed before.\n\n\n\nBefore it feasts upon the world.",

There are so few books that manage the lightness of spirit and being so filled with love (romantic, familial, of art, and of a place) as this one, without being trite or too sweet. It felt like a miracle to me! I also happen to love that area of Northern Michigan, and the daughters and mother relationship reminded me a lot of my own family dynamic, so I\u2019m sure that helped its personal resonance with me. My other favorite title from the author is State of Wonder, way more action and plot oriented, so you might check that one out if this one felt a little dull. For another of hers that is more reserved and exquisite like TL I also loved Commonwealth.",

They have the same \u201cforced to fight and play games in order to survive\u201d type of premise. DCC has a lot more humor though, and the stakes feel higher. It\u2019s under the LitRPG genre which I\u2019d never heard of before this book, but essentially if you play video games or RPGs (or just have some general knowledge about them), you\u2019ll probably enjoy it. I wasn\u2019t sure about it at first because both the title and the premise sound pretty silly, but it was such a compelling read from the get go. I\u2019d highly recommend the audiobook as Jeff Hays is a fantastic narrator and really brought the characters and scenes to life. There\u2019s also a good balance of humor and seriousness.",

We are struggling to find another book we would be interest in. We enjoy the thriller/mystery type genres as well as books that has interesting twists and endings! We all had read silence of the lambs in high school as well and loved it, we have looked into the other books but we have yet to agree on those just yet. We also all read To Kill a Mockingbird and enjoyed that as well! We prefer a little bit of shorter chapters (5-10 pages maybe?) As well as not a lot of shifting POVs, we recently did not want to start Dirt Creek - Heyley Scrivenor mostly just because we dislike the constant POV shifts. We all also enjoy cryptids, but we have yet to find a book here we can agree on! Any suggestions are welcome. Thank You !",

Can\u2019t recall a time I \u201ccouldn\u2019t put a book down.\u201d I couldn\u2019t get into any of these beyond a chapter or 2. I just got bored so quickly. Yet I can sit and watch a movie that\u2019s 3 and a half hours long without much issue. I\u2019ve tried audiobook format too. Some of my favorite films are:\n\nArrival\n\nBlade Runner\n\nBasically all of Tarantino and Scorsese\n\nThe Shining\n\nChunking Express\n\nAkira\n\n2001\n\nDune (both. Book didn\u2019t grip me though)\n\nTrainspotting\n\nFull Metal Jacket\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nFargo\n\nI almost don\u2019t even care what genre something is though I guess I lean sci fi or something. It just has to be good? I think what I love most about my favorites is how gripping and \u201cnatural\u201d they are - nothing ever feels written as forced and it feels like the director isn\u2019t assuming that you are stupid. You can tell the people behind these projects cared about them. Combined with interesting plots and visuals of course. I\u2019m not a critic so bear with me lol. \n",

Ibn Fattouma is by far the better book, as Mark Twain said, the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning.  I picked up several other Mahfouz books at a used book sale afterward.

        "selftext": "I watched Jordan Peterson\u2019s video where he referred to his reading list on his website as a starting point for self education; works he deems to be by some of the greatest writers such as Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn, Huxley, Nietzsche, and Jung.\n\nThe problem is however that I\u2019m quite limited in my reading comprehension skills and these writers are very deep so I\u2019m quite intimidated by the depth and breadth of their work as someone who has barely read anything.\n\nThe only book I\u2019ve read is 1984, the most difficult part of that book was the section designated to describing the intricacies and developments of how the fascist tyrannical ideology of big brother came to power and the ways in which the government has control over the people with using concepts such as double think. Most of the details of that section went well over my head, and overall, it wasn\u2019t an enjoyable read for me.\n\nI tried reading the laws of human nature by Robert Greene but I\u2019m taking a break from it after having read the first 100 pages, from which I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve learned much, though perhaps it\u2019s too soon to judge or read too little to expect increased knowledge and insight?\n\nThere are a few books that caught my interest; Behave by Robert Sapolsky, The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt, and The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow.\n\nI\u2019m interested in learning more about psychology; particularly about human nature,  our commonalities and differences, and why we adopt certain beliefs and values which vary across different societies, cultures, and eras.\n\nPolitics: I know nothing about this subject. For this I found an accessible book called \u201cChomsky for Beginners\u201d by David Cogswell. I chose Chomsky because he\u2019s known to be the greatest intellectual alive, and is an erudite figure in the political sphere. \n\nEconomics: my least favourite topic but it\u2019s essential to learn about to understand how the world works in terms of money, financing, banking, production and buying/selling of goods, and how it plays a major role in the GDP of a country and how developed they are. \n\nHistory: particularly grand history which tells the story of how we humans emerged out of the savannas of Africa 200,000 years ago, how our ancestors lived as hunter gatherers and eventually settled with the development of agriculture, forming organised societies over thousands of years. This leads me to evolutionary biology which I\u2019d also like to educate myself in.\n\nPhilosophy : it\u2019s a broad and daunting subject, but learning logic and logical fallacies are important to form good arguments and identify bad ones. And critical thinking is essential. \n\nTLDR; Is Jordan Peterson\u2019s reading list worth ploughing through as a complete beginner to reading who knows close to nothing about the world, or is there a better approach? If so, I\u2019m open to hearing your suggestions.",

From personal experience, the amount of books I consume per year probably quadrupled, when I started listening to audiobooks as well. Such a good way to rip through more books while driving places, doing chores, or even just lying in bed at night. And a good narrator is a singularly delightful experience as well.

If feel like you'd just be \"ploughing\" through it, I don't think the benefits would be high enough. Behave by Robert Sapolsky is really wonderful, though, but not sure how dense it might read to you.\n\nI'd recommend The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, by Oliver Sacks, for a nice blend of neuroscience and philosophy. He weaves really complex science into funny anecdotes and is pretty accessible I think. \n\nIf you want to *know* Chomsky well, I'd probably start with another author to give you a basic look at linguistics before diving into old Noam's works. McWhorter has a few really good but really short works on language and its modern usage. The classic pick is Nine Nasty Words, which is about the usage of swears.\n\nFor logic and logical fallacies, I'd read some Descartes to be honest, but dude is incredibly long-winded. If you wanted to start with him, though, read the first meditation in Meditations on First Philosophy. (There are six meditations in Meditations, but the first is the best for your interests I think.) Nietzsche is good, but really easy to misinterpret, so just be wary. I'd start with Beyond Good and Evil, but seriously consider pushing Nietzsche off until later. \n\nI'm also a big fan of short story collections and would recommend Kafka's short stories as well as Ursula K Le Guin's short story The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas, which is a really good introduction into thinking about ethics and morality. \n\nThis list is definitely philosophy-forward, and more granularly epistemology-forward, but that's just because this is what I'm interested in! Good luck!\n\nETA: Journey to the West, probably the most well-known Chinese mythological text, is super readable and, I think, hilarious. Highly recommend.",

It's a clear summary of a few decades of sociology research, which I find to be an excellent underpinning to a lot of what's driving day-to-day politics.\n\nHistory: I've heard Graeber's books are good. You could do worse than Yuval Noah Harari's Sapiens. It gets a bit of criticism for being oversimplified and so on, but that's true of any pop \"grand history\" book, and this one is at least very well written. Just remember it's a starting point, not the final word. All of that applies to Guns, Germs & Steel too.\n\nPsychology: I highly recommend The Culture Map by Erin Meyer as a practical and wide-ranging explanation of cultural differences in communication and thinking.\n\nRe Jordan Peterson: his life advice is basically fine, but his evolutionary psychology is extremely weak (it's not at all his discipline as an academic), and his pronouncements about society are not at all based in fact. They're just his own weird grudges. Don't trust his judgement about anyone else - positive or negative.",

Some might say that to boast but I'm saying that as a sad fact\n\nAt 26 I started reading for myself. I went to the library and picked every **short book** I found. \n\nIf you don't mind me saying, you sound in a rush. You want to learn everything **now**. Dare I say, you want it **now** so you can stop afterward. \n\nI'd recommend you lock your mind in the idea that this journey is never-ending. So **relax, take it slow**, do not follow the trends (JP is a trend, Self Help section is a trend) and just follow your interests as they come. Trust that **you have plenty of time** to read everything you want. And, allow yourself to read what it feels like at the moment. \n\nI remember reading Guns Germs and Steel by Jared Diamond and its content serving me well for a few months. In that many other books I got to reading I was like \"oh, that's like what Diamond said\".\n\nI have read the few usual suspects when it comes to introduction to philosophy, but my favorite was The Passion of the Western Mind by Richard Tarnas\n\n### Please do not forget fiction\n\nWe do live in a climate when reading 100 self-help books and getting no real improvement is seen as a good thing and fiction is seen as a waste of time, but honestly, fiction has completely changed my inner world\n\nAnd, it can definitely be an introduction to concrete ideas. **Find what you are insecure about** and then somehow find fictional books that speak to those. For example **Einstein's Dreams by Alan Lightman** spoke to me in a way that no self-help book on confidence could eve do (**And**, the amazing thing is, most likely it will not speak to you at all)\n\nMy recommendation is, find authers that everyone talks about, those that stood the  test of time, **and read their short stories/works**\n\nI get that my opinion of Peterson is also political, if you like him, if you get anything from him, so be it. However, for all such people my thinking is \"If they say anything unique and important, other books will quote them\". Like you mentioned Chomsky, I haven't read him at all but so many other books I've read have quoted him. I've read \"The Trial\" by Kafka. I was too whatever to get it, but I read so many other books that mention The Trial, so I know what he was trying to say\n\nNote: We live in good times\n\nBooks like The Dawn of Everything by David Graeber and David Wengrow are kind of becoming popular, or at least you can find enough of them. Books that tell us another narrative to the usual stuff. **Eve: How the Female Body Drove 200 Million Years of Human Evolution by Cat Bohannon** comes to mind - evolution from a female perspective.\n\nHumans: A Brief History of How We F*cked It All Up by Tom Phillips. I don't remember much of it but I remember it was good \n\n\n## Take up writing\n\nI've only recently started writing around ideas I read about and it makes a huge difference. Learn contemplative writing. Start writing whatever is stuck on your mind about what you have read. Not a review, not an essay with intro, middle, conclusion, just whatever comes to mind\n\nI've started doing it this month and the difference is huge. You know a lot more than you think you do if you do something with what you read i.e. write.\n\n[Review: The Laws of Human Nature](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2571952273)",

                "body": "First off, good on you for working to become a more informed and engaged person! Some of the most interesting and well-read people I know are self-educated.\n\n1. Start with facts work towards arguments. Lean a little history and science first, so that you have a factual framework for understanding political and cultural arguments. \n\n2. Pay attention to your sources, read widely but always consider the bias of the writers. Check the publisher, are they reputable? Is the author a researcher and an expert in the field or a talking head who's famous for shouting? Bill O'Reilly and Doris Kerns Goodwin have both written non-fiction books on Lincoln, but they vary dramatically in the quality of information. My rule of thumb is any book with a picture of the author on the cover that isn't explicitly a memoir is propaganda. That doesn't mean it's not worth reading, but you want to read it critically.\n\n3. Books are great for learning, but should only be one factor in your media diet. Magazines like The Week are great for starting to fill you in on current events, they do short-form easy to access summaries of news and world events. Start with shorter reading and work up to longer reading. Podcasts are also great. I recommend pretty much everything NPR puts out, in particular Planet Money does a great job of breaking down basic economic concepts. NPRs politics and culture podcasts do tend to lean center left, but they are generally well-researched with good facts and don't disparage other viewpoints. If you like podcasts, you might find it easier to listen to audiobooks. Apps like Libby will let you listen for free through your local library. \n\n4. I find that active reading helps me with difficult books. If I own the book I will underline passages that I liked, write notes and questions in the margins etc. I find this really helps me stay focused and process the information. If at all possible find someone to talk with about what you are reading.\n\n5. Don't suffer through a book just because it's good for you. There are so many great books out there and you're never going to get through them all. Reading is one of life's great pleasures, enjoy it! Reading literature is valuable, reading for fun is valuable. \n\nAs for specific recommendations: Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari touches on a lot of your interests.",

I'm not the fastest reader and I'm totally okay with just reading away at my own pace\n\nI do enjoy longer books they just take me a bit to get through\n\nI'm thinking a series would be awesome to get into, but I have no idea where to begin!

Read them in the reading order recommended by Bujold, because she wrote them slightly out-of-order. They are set in a fascinating world, and they have great characters who grow and mature throughout the series. Bujold\u2019s plots are ingenious and varied. Some are quests, capers, or mysteries. Violence and suffering has to be mentioned for the plots to make sense, but they are not gory or overwhelming.

Lots of banter, heavy on the character and plot tropes (with one or two lampshades). Note that the author is problematic once you dig into his history, but I still recommend the books.\n\nFor urban fantasy, I can\u2019t help but recommend the Dresden Files series by Jim Butcher. It\u2019s long - 17 books and still going strong - but each one is worth reading. If you\u2019re into audiobooks, this is especially one to pick out, as James Marsters has practically made Harry Dresden his own character.\n\nIt\u2019s a bit harder to find, but I have a special place in my heart for _Songs of Earth and Power_ by Greg Bear, which was originally published as two books, _The Infinity Concerto_ and _The Serpent Mage_. What makes this story unique is the importance of art in magic \u2014 mostly music, but other art forms like poetry, dance, etc., become the basis of powerful magics.",

An incredibly powerful demon trapped in the body of a sarcastic cat? Check. Magic systems? Check. Evil necromancy? Check. Good necromancy? Check. Walking into death? Check.

The 3 things gave you something better to get started.

Near the ceiling was a shelf that ran around the large room and it was completely full of things packed fairly tightly.  One child would point at any object and Twain would tell a new story going around the room using every item on the shelf in order ending where he started.  The best time a different object would be selected and he'd tell a whole new story..  us mortals can play that game too but with each change of objectbthe next person has to continue the story.

I will say I found it kind of boring but I also was not the intended audience given that I've kind of aged out of it's demographic.\n\nPercy Jackson might not have been her cup of tea but I'd give the Kane Chronicles a try, although they focus on Egyptian gods and descendants.\n\nWEBTOONS Red Hood: Outlaws is a good read although not really a retelling. It's a digital comic on the webtoon app from DC Comics (the guys who make Batman). The age rating is officially 13+ and it has Medusa and another gorgon as characters in some of the arcs, also includes LGBT characters. I do think you can get it in a physical edition as well. (If she does enjoy it, also worth looking into Wonder Woman comics in general).",

I want to be on the edge of my seat out of excitement, not tension that the protagonist is gonna get caught.\n\nIt definitely doesn't have to be realistic -- if anything, superhuman abilities would be a plus. Sci-fi is my preferred genre, but I also enjoy fantasy.\n\nThanks in advance!",

He was very likely an inspiration for Marvel Comics' The Punisher.\n\n[Matt Helm series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/42822-matt-helm) by Donald Hamilton - At the time, considered the grittier more realistic counterpart to James Bond.\n\n[The Death Merchant series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/143730-the-death-merchant) by Joseph Rosenberger - More nihilistic, mercenary character. He's a hero for hire. Lots of technical info on guns and martial arts. \n\n###Different and interesting action series\n\n[John Keller series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/49488-john-keller) by Lawrence Block - Comedic tone.\n\n[Burke series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/54555-burke) by Andrew Vachss - For something much darker in a big bad city.\n\n[Atticus Kodiak series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/64391-atticus-kodiak) by Greg Rucka - He's a bodyguard, not a killer. Rucka is also a comic book writer, and it shows in the long-running storylines. You'll want to read these books in order, they form one long story. \n\n[John Corey series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/52228-john-corey) by Nelson DeMille - Corey is a nice break from the usual cold, humorless, former Special ops badasses you see in most thriller novels. He's a wise-cracking NYPD cop and the books are mostly written in the first person from his point of view. Almost like he'd been dropped into an international thriller novel from a different book about gritty cops.\n\nIf you like John McClane in the *Die Hard* movies, you'll like Corey.\n\nFor something a bit different, you might like the \"Florida adventurer\" sub-genre:\n\n[Travis McGee series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/52264-travis-mcgee) by John D. MacDonald - This character was the father of the sub-genre. Great series. If someone has their fortune scammed or stolen from them, Travis will \"salvage\" it for them and get it back, in exchange for half the value. \n\n[Thorn series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/52139-thorn-mystery) by James W. Hall - Dark series about a lone vigilante. \n\n[Morgan Hunt series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/113444-morgan-hunt) by Geoffrey Norman - I love the writing. That part of Florida that feels like the Old South really comes alive.\n\n[Doc Ford series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/52573-doc-ford-mystery) by Randy Wayne White - A more experimental series, the books can be very different from each other.\n\n[John Deal series](https://www.goodreads.com/series/90090-john-deal) - A different kind of protagonist, he's a struggling building contractor who gets sucked into criminal conspiracies. Great action scenes.\n\nHope this helps.",

They follow the main character as she grows from a child to a young woman who steadily takes on responsibility for a whole community around her. As part of this, one of the later books may be a little mature for a ten year old. I'd suggest reading I shall Wear Midnight alone before reading it together. The topics it covers are important, but potentially upsetting. You may find she's mature enough for this, and it may be a good way to discuss the topics involved, or you may want to wait for a year or so.\n\nIn addition to Howl's Moving Castle, you might want to check out Diana Wynne Jone's huge catalogue of books. They vary in intended age, but most are worth reading.",

Said it was the most boring book they have ever read.\n4. Jar of Hearts - It was okay! I am more of a Non-Fiction person but I enjoyed it for what it was.\n\nDid read Pretty Girls and LOVED that. Oh so great.\n\nSo I am looking for recommendations for books that really got in your head. Ones that you still think about. We have felt pretty let down by the last three books. We like Gregg Olsen a lot and Karin Slaughter as writers.\n\nBut I am really looking for books that were or almost were DNF",

If you know of anyone that has PTSD from a traumatic experience, your heart will break for the poor survivor, that gets no understanding from the LAPD. Plenty for a book discusion.",

She has an incredible way with words, being comforting but disturbing at the same time. Maybe because I relate to her characters more than I would like admit. \nApart from her, Mary Shelley, Madeline Miller, Franz Kafka, Fyodor Dostoevsky, because of their profound study of human mind and behaviour. There's always something new to observe and learn. For example, Madeline Miller 'Circe' takes inspiration from Greek mythology, but I used her character for a (pedagogy course) essay on analysis of individual character development influenced by a toxic environment; she is a perfect example on how people grow up affected by certain influences and can develop further in the way that they prefer. Also, Holly Jackson because I loved the AGGGTM series, brought me back to childhood and revived my obsession with detective stories..",

The story itself is unimportant, what matters is only the way they tell the story using their words.",

Next up is Geek Love by Katherine Dunn (apparently I have a thing for novels that came out in 1989. Lol). I cannot remember what inspired me to read that one, but I\u2019ve only read it once and I can still remember so much from it almost 35 years later!

Also, after each chapter, there would be a statistics page for those who love numbers & stats.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*Here's the breakdown:\\*\\*\n\n\n\nSymbols trigger under specific conditions such as:\n\n\n\n- The word 'prince' is mentioned.\n\n- There's a palindrome of at least 10 characters on the page.\n\n- A chain of 6 or more words where the last letter of one word is the first of the next.\n\n\n\nThis added layer of engagement is optional\u2014you can choose to dive into the puzzle-solving aspect or simply read the literature in its traditional form and do the riddles later. I would also like to do five difficulty levels, and resolve every riddle at the back of the book.\n\n\n\n\\*\\*I have two key questions for you:\\*\\*\n\n\n\n- Would a book that combines reading with content-based riddle solving appeal to you? How would you prefer to interact with such a book?\n\n- What are your thoughts on integrating these elements into classic literature? Does it enhance the experience, or could it potentially detract from the original works?\n\n\n\nI\u2019m eager to hear your feedback! (I know I would love to have such a book, but I also now that I am a not the most normal person on this planet :D)\n\n\n\nThank you for your time and thoughts!",

John Barton describes how the narratives, laws, proverbs, prophecies, poems and letters which comprise the Bible were written and when, what we know - and what we cannot know - about their authors and what they might have meant, as well as how these extraordinarily disparate writings relate to each other. His incisive readings shed new light on even the most familiar passages, exposing not only the sources and traditions behind them, but also the busy hands of the scribes and editors who assembled and reshaped them. Untangling the process by which some texts which were regarded as holy, became canonical and were included, and others didn't, Barton demonstrates that the Bible is not the fixed text it is often perceived to be, but the result of a long and intriguing evolution.\n\nTracing its dissemination, translation and interpretation in Judaism and Christianity from Antiquity to the rise of modern biblical scholarship, Barton elucidates how meaning has both been drawn from the Bible and imposed upon it. Part of the book's originality is to illuminate the gap between religion and scripture, the ways in which neither maps exactly onto the other.\n\nIt is a very accessible easy to read book written by a world expert for laypeople and the public.",

All of the different storylines you\u2019ve followed reach their brilliant conclusions. I personally believe, and I\u2019m sure others may agree, it\u2019s what really makes Lonesome Dove the best Western ever written.\n\nPlease don\u2019t let me pressure you into finishing the book though! It\u2019s ultimately your decision- but I do honestly believe you\u2019ll enjoy it if you keep going. It\u2019s one of the most slow paced books I\u2019ve ever read, it truly does feel like you\u2019re on that cattle drive with them. But McMurtry really does know how to create suspense and thrill. There were points in part 3 that I could NOT put down. I\u2019ve always considered it to be more of a \u2018slow burner\u2019.\n\nYou\u2019ve come this far\u2026 don\u2019t give up now!

I\u2019m not interested in anything holocaust related but more a historical account of the 20 something years after the signing of the treaty of Versailles up to September 1939. The focus doesn\u2019t need to be specifically on the political party but I\u2019m hoping to gain a better understanding of how life was changing for everyday citizens and how conditions were primed for the rise of fascism in that time period. Any recommendations are appreciated! Thanks so much!",

You don't need to be a super fan, because it explains how tactics work by talking about they were developed, not how they're implemented today. So you don't need to watch a ton of soccer or already be engaged with it, but as you learn about what teams have done in the past you'll start to see echoes of them in the modern game, and things will really click. It can be a little dry, but for the most part it does a good job using storytelling to teach.\u00a0\n\n\nAll of which is to say, dive in!

More social satire than mystery. \n\nMy Sister the Serial Killer - Oyinkan Braithwaite - I just love this novella, very dark, very funny.",

I read Arabian nights recently and enjoyed the style of writing - I'm not sure if there's a term for it , or if it's simply the effect of translation a foreign language to English, it somehow simplifies the text without losing its appeal . I find primary English authors sometimes a bit too flowery with their language, saying in 50 words what could be said in 10. It's not to say I dislike them but reading time is more precious these days with a family.\n\n\nI somehow had that same vibe reading a few authors  Mohsin Hamid's Reluctant Fundamentalist,  Yoko Ogawa's Memory Police and Salman Rushdie's Shalimar the Clown. \n\n\nMaybe it's the story within a story sort of style, or the authors who did not grow up in primarily English speaking countries initially.\n\n\nMaybe I'm just talking rubbish , but if you get what I mean,I'd love to hear your recommendations ",

Life seems to hate her but she chugs on, waiting for it to finally be her day) \n\nAlternatively, it could be cool if you picked a book to help her understand you/your interests, and then she picked one, etc. That way, you\u2019re both able to really invest into what interests the other, and you both feel like you get a turn to pick something you\u2019ll really personally love",

It's a quiet, domestic story following ordinary people through the ordinary changes that happen over a few years (marriage, falling in and out of love, birth, loss, aging, illness, and realizing that even the most seemingly immutable things change) - and the part that makes me feel hopeful and restores my faith in humanity is Chekhov's approach to his characters.  They're all flawed and make questionable choices, but he writes them with such deep compassion, not judgment, simply offering them up with zen like this-ness, is-ness, such-ness.\n\nAnd it's full of surprising and deeply moving turns.  A young woman feeling dismal and hopeless about her marriage goes back to her father's house; she has a brief burst of optimism about staying with him and renewing their relationship, but before long remembers exactly why she left in the first place and feels dismal and hopeless there too.  She goes to bed early and has a nightmare about a coffin pounding on the door like a battering ram, and wakes up to find someone is indeed pounding on the door - but it turns out to be a telegram from her husband's friends, who were up late partying and had the awesome drunken idea to send her a message in the middle of the night just to say they're drinking to her health.  She bursts out laughing - oh, the idiots! - and goes back to bed in peace with a light heart.  And Chekhov just keeps doing wonderful stuff like that.",

CW: a pet dog is killed in the first few pages but comes back as a saint very soon. Burning of a Jewish town. The violence is not very graphic but the fear is there.)\n\nThe Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making, Catherynne Valente (Set during WWII on the home front--mom is away working. Not much focus on history, though)\n\nRoot Magic, set in American South during Civil Rights Era. Don't remember any violence on page but definite fear of a racist police force.\n\nThe Lost Ryu (Japanese fantasy). Set a couple decades after Hiroshima. Dark historical themes but deals with emotions more than any act of violence. Families have small talking dragons. EDIT: this is much more slice-of-life and wouldn't be my choice if she really likes adventurous books.\n\nHistorical YA fantasy:\n\nWhen the Angels Left the Old Country (Jewish folklore, interactions with crime boss but nothing really graphic?)\n\nSorcery and Cecilia: or the Enchanted Chocolate Pot, (Regency female friends try to stop a magical plot)\n\nAdult historical fantasy/sci-fi:\n\nJonathan Strange and Mister Norell. (Two obsessive magicians try to bring magic back to England. Fae magic)\n\nTo Say Nothing of the Dog (Two time-traveling historians go back to Victorian England to try to study artifacts in situ. Very funny.) EDIT: oh, the author has another book in the series, The Doomsday Book, which I WOULD NOT recommend for this. It's very very bleak.",

It's a closed door f/f Fantasy romance with politics, a woman with a sword, great worldbuilding and magic.\n\n*His Majesty's Dragon* by Naomi Novik is the Napoleonic wars with dragons. No magic, just intelligent dragons.\n\nThe Glamourist History books (first book *Shades of Milk and Honey*) by Mary Roibinette Kowal is also set during the Napoleonic Wars. It's basically Pride and Prejudice with magic.\n\n(There's a whole subgenre of Fantasy books that are basically Regency Romances with magic called \"Fantasy of Manners\" you might check out.)\n\nTo get your daughter out of a rut: Anything and everything by Tamora Pierce, Diana Wynne Jones, Ursula LeGuin, most of T.

The man was born into poverty and worked his way into high society by gaining recognition as a magician. He befriends the younger cousin and helps her discover that she has telekinetic powers as well. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, but the man and older cousin (both in late 20s) also have a connection. The writing is wonderfully descriptive.

Instead, I eventually became partial to video games and film for that escape.  That said, I never forgot what passionate reading FELT like.  The feeling of being engrossed in a well-crafted book is simply unparalleled\u2026\n\nOver the past few years, I\u2019ve dealt with a failed long-term relationship and a complete collapse of the life I\u2019d built.  I\u2019m well over the hump now, and I\u2019m brimming with an optimism and lust for life that I\u2019ve never known.  Something inside of me has kept thinking about books, but much to my dismay, reading physical books (despite my love and preference for [old \ud83e\udd74] hardback particularly) has become something I\u2019ve struggled with.  So after days of research, I begrudgingly bought a Kindle to assist me in facilitating the reading habit, and it\u2019s coming tomorrow.\n\nImma be so real with y\u2019all: I ain\u2019t been this excited about something in a long time.  \n\nIn anticipation of its arrival, I started looking at broad book recommendations and quickly became overwhelmed by the vast array of titles and varying degrees of quality (and the obvious factor of subjectivity).\n\nFrankly, I don\u2019t know where to dive in.  I don\u2019t even necessarily have a genre preference.  All I know is what I \u201cwant\u201d from a book-reading experience.  I figured I\u2019d give this sub a shot as I begin to build my digital library.  Why not pick the brains of the most passionate readers?\n\nWhile I like the aesthetics of fantasy, or the bleakness of horror, and that fuzzy, heart-fluttering feeling of a good romance, I guess I want to read books that really capture the beauty of life/\u201chuman\u201d spirit in some way\u2014be it in adventure, friendship, romantic love, etc.  The kind of book that when I finish it, changes me in some small way forever.  Something that resonates and stays with me long after reading the final page.\n\nI want to laugh.  I want to cry.  I want to mourn. I want to be moved.  I want to truly succumb to the majesty of life through artful literary depictions.  I\u2019m chasing that feeling when I read books.\n\n\ntl;dr\u2014i\u2019m a 30yo contemplative caveman and i haven\u2019t read a fiction book for fun in nearly two decades. pls help.",

Not to be confused with The Invisible Man by H.G. Wells.) \n- Brave New World\n\nYou seem to like classic movies, so I\u2019d assume you\u2019d like some classic books as well. Those listed above also have some common themes or settings to your favorite movies. \n\nHere are a few general tips for a new reader, if you want them: \n\nYou may find as you go along that some books are more difficult to get invested in. Don\u2019t make reading a chore right out the gate! I recommend that you put anything like that aside for a while and only try again once you\u2019ve gotten through a few you\u2019ve enjoyed.

(Black Mirror, Children of Men)\n\nIt concerns a young woman who inherits control of an 'organisation' run by her absent, deadbeat father in a technocratic, libertarian city and her learning about it and the problems that come with being his heir (Dune?). This involves solving problems in violent (Inglorious Bastards, Sicario), smart (Oppenheimer) and creative futuristic ways (Snowpeircer, Black Mirror, Inception) while looking askance at the world (Parasite, Black Mirror)\n\nThey are engaging and easy to read, but smart enough to hold your interest. There is a series of them, and the author has also written horror/splatterpunk stuff (John Dies at the End - also made into a weird movie) and has some stand alone stuff coming out soon.\n\nGive it a go, I don't think you'll regret it, and if you do like them, that's a great grounding point for reading other things.",

I agree Andy Weir as others have said. Also the Expanse series is great space opera that the show was adapted from. \n\nFor the black mirror episodic type stuff, consider reading Ted Chiang's short story collections \"Exhalation\" and \"Stories of Your Life and Others\" (<- this contains \"Story of Your Life\" from which the movie Arrival was adapted). He's probably my favorite sci-fi author, his short stories are brilliant and he wins tons of Hugo and Nebula awards for them.",

(The movie w/ Harrison Ford was terrible, don\u2019t base it on that.)\n\n*******\n\nThe apocalypse will be televised!\nA man. His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.\n\nIn a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth\u2014from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds\u2014collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.\n\nThe buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.\n\nOnly a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.\n\nYou can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.\n\nYou gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that \"it\" factor, you may just find yourself with a following. That's the only way to truly survive in this game\u2014with the help of the loot boxes dropped upon you by the generous benefactors watching from across the galaxy.\n\nThey call it Dungeon Crawler World. But for Carl, it's anything but a game.",

It had a bit of a medieval vibe I guess, but I just enjoyed the world building of the society, the cooks working in the kitchen, going to see hanging on the hill and the duel between him and his trainer. \n\nI guess I want a sort of coming of age medieval story that doesn't necessarily have to have magic involved. Not looking for YA stuff.\n\nI know a lot of fantasy/sci-fi books can be dense with many plotlines and characters going on. Ideally this would be a pretty straightforward story following one character's journey mostly \n\nthanks in advance",

        "selftext": "Hey, guys!\n\nO. Henry is one of my favorite writers and I really enjoy his style of writing (interesting allusions, metaphors, clever turns of phrase, etc.).\n\nI was hoping you could recommend some other writers or stand-alone novels/stories (of any genre) which I should like if I love O. Henry\u2019s witty manner of storytelling and funny dialogues (\u201csurprise twists\u201d at the end are not necessary\u2013 just a compelling and witty writing).\n\nJust to let you know, I\u2019ve read Douglas Adams, Terry Pratchett, Jerome K. Jerome and P.G. Wodehouse, but they didn\u2019t really click with me the same way.\n\nTo give you an example of the kind of humour that I find entertaining, here\u2019s an\u00a0 excerpt from O. Henry\u2019s novel \u201cTwo renegades\u201d:\n\n\u201cThen and there those Colombians\u2026 dragged me before a military court. The presiding general went through the usual legal formalities that sometimes cause a case to hang on the calendar of a South American military court as long as ten minutes. He asked me my age, and then sentenced me to be shot.\n\n\u201cThey woke up the court interpreter, an American named Jenks, who was in the rum business and vice versa, and told him to translate the verdict.\n\n\u201cJenks stretched himself and took a morphine tablet.\n\n\u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to back up against th\u2019 \u2018dobe, old man,\u2019 says he to me. \u2018Three weeks, I believe, you get. Haven\u2019t got a chew of fine-cut on you, have you?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Translate that again, with foot-notes and a glossary,\u2019 says I. \u2018I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019m discharged, condemned, or handed over to the Gerry Society.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Oh,\u2019 says Jenks, \u2018don\u2019t you understand? You\u2019re to be stood up against a \u2018dobe wall and shot in two or three weeks \u2014 three, I think, they said.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Would you mind asking \u2018em which?\u2019 says I. \u2018A week don\u2019t amount to much after you\u2019re dead, but it seems a real nice long spell while you are alive.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018It\u2019s two weeks,\u2019 says the interpreter, after inquiring in Spanish of the court. \u2018Shall I ask \u2018em again?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Let be,\u2019 says I. \u2018Let\u2019s have a stationary verdict. If I keep on appealing this way they\u2019ll have me shot about ten days before I was captured. No, I haven\u2019t got any fine-cut.\u2019\n\n\u00a0\u201cThen I gives a silver dollar to one of the guards to send for the United States consul. He comes around in pajamas, with a pair of glasses on his nose and a dozen or two inside of him.\n\n\u201c\u2018I\u2019m to be shot in two weeks,\u2019 says I. \u2018And although I\u2019ve made a memorandum of it, I don\u2019t seem to get it off my mind. You want to call up Uncle Sam on the cable as quick as you can and get him all worked up about it.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Now, see here, O\u2019Keefe,\u2019 says the consul, getting the best of a hiccup, \u2018what do you want to bother the State Department about this matter for?\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018Didn\u2019t you hear me?\u2019 says I; \u2018I\u2019m to be shot in two weeks. Did you think I said I was going to a lawn-party?\u201d.\n\nP.S.\n\nOne other work that i felt was akin to O.Henry's clever writing and the one i enjoyed a lot was Steve Toltz\u2019s novel \u201cA fraction of the whole\u201d.\n\nThank you! \u00a0\n\nP.P.S.\n\nMade the same post at booksuggestions.",

I have a story on there that I think is fun and the chapters are set up to make it a nice read whenever you have 5 or 10 minutes of free time to get a chapter in. Plus, the first 10 chapters are always free so you can check it out to see if you like it. \n\nI may be biased, but I think it's an easy read. I wrote it in very casual conversational style that readers have really liked so far.\n\nI don't know quite how to compare it to any other story because it's a little different than anything I have ever read. It's basically a slightly surreal, fish out of water story, with a little romantic comedy mixed in.\n\n[https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/episode/B0CW1Q8GCC](https://www.amazon.com/kindle-vella/episode/B0CW1Q8GCC) Please check it out and let me know what you think!",

Usually, I enjoyed reading books like 'Piranesi' by Susanna Clarke, 'A little life' by Hanya Yanagihara, or 'In perfect light' by Benjamin Alire S\u00e1enz where there are a lot of introspection and inner journey that characters need to embark on... \n\nThere are number of books that on my list now: 'Young Mungo' by Douglas Stuart, and 'Normal People' by Sally Rooney. However, I would love to read something lighter in tone as I would kill for a bit of escapism. I was wondering whether there are any light-hearted or cosy books that are similiar to Ghost Whisperer or Heartstopper (preferably adults books, but YA are fine too). \n\nThe Ghost Whisperer show is about Melinda Gordon who can see and hear earthbound spirits that she helps to cross-over by helping them resolve some of them unfinished business or help them find peace. The episodes are usually very heart warming and it is more about being emotionally vulnerable and being able to find forgiveness for yourself and others. Heartstopper has healed my inner teenager as it tells a beautiful story about two teenagers who navigate their identities and their lovely relationship. I love both of those shows for modelling a healthy communication and boundaries. \n\nIn my younger years, I have read my fair share of YA LGBTQ+ stories ('More happy than not', 'We are the ants' or 'Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe'). I love fantasy element set in contemporary world too. Perhaps I am asking for something too specific, but I would be grateful for any recommendations. ",

Excellent cookbook but I bought it for one cookie recipe but I can't find it quickly in the book its a weird Austrian name its a chocolate shortbread cookie with red pepper in it.  But everything I cooked from it in past was outstanding and recipes were easy to follow.  I haven't used it in years because I'm a diabetic who has limited willpower\n\nIf you like historical cookbooks then try Esscoffier Cookbook by Aguste Escoffier. Or Larousse Gastronomique. You have to make sure you get the English versions.  The latter one is the most difficult cookbook I've ever used.  It assumes you are already are a fully trained French chef. If you find something you want to fix it says make x but change it this way assuming you already know how to make x.  When you go to the recipe for x it says make w and z and modify a and b this way.  So if you already aren't trained you have to create your own recipe by unpacking all the previous stages.  From the few times I I went through the trouble the results were worth it.   Newer versions of this cookbook may have fixed it.\n\nThe Best of Shaker Cooking by Miller and Fuller.",

Death isn\u2019t the main plot point, but it is a location. \n\nIf you\u2019re up for a quick read (YA Fantasy), check out Sabriel by Garth Nix (and if you like it, there\u2019s sequels, but if you don\u2019t, the story is wrapped up, the sequels happen years later). \n\nSabriel spends most of her time in boarding school across the wall, on the side where there\u2019s no magic. But when she\u2019s not in boarding school, she\u2019s the Abhorsen-in-Training under her father. As an Anhorsen, she is basically a Necromancer, but for good. Necromancers summon the Dead, the Abhorsen sends them back to Death. Someone dies who shouldn\u2019t? The Abhorsen travels Death to bring them back. One of the Greater Dead becomes strong enough to escape? The Abhorsen fights them off. But Sabriel isn\u2019t the Abhorsen yet, she\u2019s just a kid. And then her father goes missing. Thats right in the beginning. \n\nThe part I find neat is that a young Abhorsen-in-training learns their craft on \u201cpipes,\u201d which I assume is a pan flute-like instrument, while an Abhorsen or Necromancer would use bells. Musical necromancy. I thought it was neat, and I\u2019ve reread the books every few years. It\u2019s kind of a comfort thinking of Death as a river toward peace in the stars.",

Can be an old book too. \n\n2) something set in the underworld of crime, no fancy police chases or mafia spiciness but a good love-hate-love story doesn't have to scream a mafia don, hot girl, passion and all that but something like Love, tragedy, drama, aesthetic, secrets, Polar opposites, different lifestyles, foreign land, obsession etc. Again can be an old book won't mind that. \n\n\nSorry in advance if I sound like I don't know what I'm asking for just looking for books that have these similarities, I'm still exploring. \nThanks again! \n",

He's making pretty good money, but very isolated due to his own baggage, being shy, and working overnights. He starts as a pretty boring guy, but throughout the story he starts working on himself, building routines (like going to the gym, hanging out with friends, etc), working through his own baggage, and in between his story, he's reading emails specifically sent between two ladies in the office and developing a pseudo relationship with them.",

There are a few outliers that can be truly beneficial, but for the most part they are just a bunch of platitudes and rhetorical questions strung together to make you feel like you are both optimistic and thoughtful. That lasts for a bit. But then it stops. Hence, the cottage industry. TAKE THIS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. I obviously have problems with these things. YMMV.\n\nTolstoy is pretty much ..the opposite. It makes you do PAINFUL intellectual work in order to analyze the human condition. Nobody walks away from the Russian classics feeling optimistic and thoughtful. Hell, you hardly walk away. They drag you in and through. And the trip is fascinating, soulful, and breathtaking. But not pleasant. Be prepared for some mental and emotional gymnastics.\n\nIf both of those sound like, \"you,\" have at it. \ud83d\ude0a",

To put it simply, I'm looking for a sci-fi romance that involves a male human, and a female presenting Robot/AI that is not exactly human-like. A humanoid shape is fine, but what I'm\u00a0**not**\u00a0looking for is Detroit Become Human type of robots/androids. Think more **Transformers**.\n\nI've searched around a lot already, but any relevant post I find generally involves very human-like robots, ones that are either physically indistinguishable or very similar looking to humans, things of that nature.\n\nCan anyone help me out?",

But it made me cry and it gifted me with a level of empathy that I remember denying I have. \n\nYou lost your son, he appears to you somehow, what would you do so that he stays in your life? \n\nI've seen a few movies like this and I never felt more than entertained (at best). \n\nA few months ago I learned that Penn and Teller have an episode where they expose people who promise they contact the dead. Penn said their intention was not to offend the grieving people who desperately cling to hope...\n\nI laughed, I thought he was full of shit. I thought he said that purely so as to not alienate their audience. This book made me get it.\n\nI'm not into horror at all. I had this book around me for weeks. I nearly did not read it at all. This book destroyed me in a good way, and unless another novel comes along that speaks of this exact topic I'm sure it will be on my mind for years.",

I get it.\n\nBut I think your list is somewhat problematic in that almost every author on this list writes in English, and lives in an English-speaking country. This is almost exclusively diaspora literature. There's nothing wrong with diaspora literature, but it is only a fragment of the entirety.\n\nJudy Lin is Taiwanese Canadian.  \nXiran Jay Zhao is Chinese Canadian.  \nR. F. Kuang is Chinese American.  \nShelly Parker Chan is Chinese Australian.  \nChloe Gong is Chinese New Zealandian.  \nAxie Oh is Korean American.  \nJoan He is Chinese American.  \nSue Lynn Tan is Malaysian American.\n\nI feel like there should be more than one author on this list who was born in a non-English speaking country and writes in a non-English language. You have Murakami, which is not nothing, but it *is* an entire continent we're talking about. There are thousands and thousands of books published every year in Chinese, Japanese, Malaysian, Bahasa Indonesia, Hindi, Telugu, Vietnamese, Tamil, Bengali, Tagalog, Cebuano, Gujarati, Korean, Punjabi, Urdu, Mongolian, Thai, Cambodian, literally a hundred other Asian languages, from a hundred Asian countries. When we're talking about Asian literature, we should be talking about more than \"literature written in English, in Australia, Canada, and the US, by people of Asian heritage\", I think.",

Joan He takes inspiration from ancient Chinese tales to write her books. As well as Sue Lynn Tan taking inspiration from ancient tales. \n\nJust because they're not currently living in the countries their ancestors came from doesn't mean they can't still love their cultures. Most, if not all of them have either lived in the countries for a little bit or have visited them, and like I mentioned actually studied the stories and cultures their works took inspiration from.\n\nYou have a point, other authors like Murakami, Dazai, Arikawa (not helping my own point by only mentioning Japanese authors) needing a wider audience. But again, and in conclusion all the authors I mentioned used the English language to bring us stories about their own cultures. I personally feel it doesn't matter where they're really currently living, the spirit of where they and their ancestors came from is in their literature.\n\n(Edited multiple times, was adding stuff as I was doing stuff. lol)",

Far be it from me. I could even add a few names of my own of Asian diaspora authors whose works I've greatly enjoyed. \"Do not say we have nothing\" by Madeleine Thien was one of my favorite books of last year, and the year before I read \"The Girl who played Go\" by Shan Sa and loved it. \"America is not the Heart\" by Elaine Castillo, also amazing. I'm a huge fan of Kazuo Ishiguro, and Jessica Hagedorn. I'm not trying to take anything away from these authors. I'd even say that factors like the experience of growing up between two cultures or the personal history of a family's emigration can add entirely new aspects to a writer's work. I don't think a Mainland Chinese author could have written \"Do not say we have nothing\"; the story is too fundamentally about emigration and identity. \"Crying in H Mart\" by Michelle Zauner is another prime example, and an absolute masterpiece. And yeah, you did provide what OP asked for!\n\nAll I'm trying to say is you're highlighting only a (relatively small) facet of the whole. If someone asked for recommendations of \"English-language literature\" and I saw a list of 7 New Zealand authors and 1 American, I'd also point that out. That doesn't mean the New Zealand authors don't qualify, or that they're not excellent literature, and if someone consciously decides to read mainly authors from New Zealand, then that is legit and valid. I just think they should be aware of it, and not mistake New Zealand for the entire anglosphere.",

And who could resist reading about his frost-bitten penis? Not me. \n\n'Lovers and Gamblers' by Jackie Collins - not well written, but it's so clearly about Tom Jones and is a great caper.\n\n 'The Other Side of Midnight' by Sidney Sheldon - I haven't read it since I was at school, but the description of what the girl thought when she first saw an erection will stay with me forever! \n\n'Strange Days' by Patricia Kennealy - it's another one where she is totally oblivious of how she is coming over, and she turns about 5 meeting with Jim Morrison into a love story for the ages. She also has a sci-fi series where she and Jim are star-crossed lovers leading the galaxy or some such, but the bad writing went too far there. \n\nAnd last of all, of course 50 Shades of Grey. Laughable from start to finish. I couldn't put myself through any others of the series though, one really was enough. As badly written as Twilight but with badly written sexy times.",

Their lives are about three things: survival, reproduction, death\u2014and nothing else. But we know too much to content ourselves with surviving, reproducing, dying\u2014and nothing else.

Set in a fictional Idaho mining town at the start of the 20th century, the story is mostly told in flashback by the main character as he comes of age (in a brothel), searches for his parents, and navigates his bisexuality and Indigenous identity in a community that is being taken over and controlled by Mormons who oppose everything about the late-frontier town ethos.

After administering to her, against his better judgement, his patient disappears under mysterious circumstances, and hijinks ensue.\n\nThe story features literary criticism, existential philosophizing, a secret society, an inconceivable entity trapped in an interdimensional cave-in, a book club/sewing circle (currently reading **The Jamais Vu Papers**), a smorgasbord of cameos from big thinkers (Paul Krasner, Tim Leary,  Fred Alan Wolf, etc), a chapter that's a comic, a chapter that's in pig latin, a chapter that's a screen play... \n\nit's unlike an book I've ever read.",

I read a lot of Post-apocalyptic novels. I was going to WDW and it can be \u00a0fun to read books set in a place you're traveling. I \u00a0also \u00a0like road trip novels. So when I \u00a0found a story about a road trip \u00a0to Walt Disney World \u00a0in the aftermath of an apocalypse \u00a0it seemed like the right choice. I didn't expect it to actually be \u00a0good though. It's really good!\n\nAudible has a whole bunch of stuff that is free. I kind of lucked into \u00a0The Sunday Pigeon Murders by Craig Rice. I thought it was set in the 40s, but it was actually published in 1942. It isn't the \u00a0\"great American \u00a0novel.\" But it is a lot of fun and oddly sweet. The audiobook is excellent if you \u00a0may decide to listen.",

The nature of the killings represented highly unusual and atypical behaviour for a tiger - even a sick and wounded one. It very much seemed that the tiger was seeking revenge on the poacher and the other villagers.\n\nThe dramatized true story was interesting on a few levels - not just the killer tiger stuff. The setting was an interesting window into post-perestroika Russia. Basically, you had these extremely remote settlements which were effectively cut off from civilization after the central communist government fell apart. Whatever non-viable infrastructure (trains and the like) that connected these places up were basically abandoned. People were forced to subsist any way they could, and being near to the Chinese border meant that tiger poaching was a dangerous but tempting way to make more money on the black market then they could through what few \u201clegal\u201d sources of employment remained.",

Andrew Miller's novel Ingenious Pain, set in the 18th century, explores how Enlightenment society dealt with the problem of pain, and is a fascinating glimpse into a different way of looking at things. I'm assuming that you aren't looking for a book about sadism etc but a mainstream novel - as you won't find anything outre in the book.\n\nHe looks at the fairly new science of surgery, the obsession with blood-letting etc and early dentistry. Of course the book is an entertainment and is full of interesting, quirky characters. The main one is a man who can feel neither pleasure nor pain - which of course is an interesting idea in itself.",

It\u2019s not a horror novel but there\u2019s one scene that kept me up all night checking to make sure were-hyenas weren\u2019t invading my suburban US home. \n\n2. Jade City by Fonda Lee. I\u2019m in the midst of it, and I\u2019m having so much fun. For a fantasy novel, it\u2019s quite approachable. It takes place in a world with t-shirts and motorcycles and business school, with the key difference that wearing jade jewelry turns certain people into superheroes. Naturally organized crime families have developed around this ability so it\u2019s a fantasy novel that folks keep comparing to The Godfather. \n\nBoth have sequels. :)",

        "selftext": "Preface: I originally tried to post this in r/books but it got removed, I think cos I ask for recommendations towards the end, so I'm posting it here instead.\n\nI recently started reading Antkind by Charlie Kaufman (highly recommend!), and it has inspired me to try to write my own comedic, metafictional, absurdist novel. I remember reading Catch-22 years ago and being surprised at how funny I found it. To this day, Antkind and Catch-22 are the only books I've ever read to actually make me laugh out loud.\r  \n\r  \nThis has made me realise that the \"comedy novel\" is kind of a thing of the past. As far as I am aware, the closest thing we have to it nowadays (with the exception of Antkind) are coffee table books written by TV comedians. A far cry from the likes of Don Quixote, often considered the first modern novel, and from what I have heard, quite funny as well.\r  \n\r  \nSo, to get to the point, I have two main questions. Firstly, why do you think comedic novels do not seem to be as common as they once were? Or to be more precise, why do modern novels hardly ever seem to have a sense of humour. To me, it feels like the authors of novels pride themselves as being more artistically sophisticated than the writers of coffee table books, and in turn see comedy as being a lesser form of artistic expression, that it is somewhat beneath them. I could also be accused of falling into this trap myself, as despite trying to write stories my whole life, this is the first time I've ever tried to write a comedy novel.\r  \n\r  \nSecondly, I would appreciate any recommendations for comedy/comedic/humorous novels (or books that have absurdist and/or metafictional elements). I am considering reading Don Quixote and The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, as from what I have heard, they both seem to be quite humorous. However, I'm sure they would also be quite challenging books, given that they are from hundreds of years ago, and the humour might be a bit stale for a 21st century reader. Thus, any comedic novels that were written more recently would be especially appreciated.",

It is wonderful story telling and is very fast paced. I found it impossible to put down and I'm not the biggest sci-f fan. I highly recommend as a short sci-fi read, you could read it in an evening at 255 pages.\n\nI'm editing this to say I didn't realise you were looking for audiobooks cos I clearly didn't read it properly. I went to listen to a sample of the audiobook on audible and it sounds good. It also says there are multiple narrators so they have different readers for the different main characters which is good. I don't listen to audiobooks but this may have convinced me to listen to this one despite having read it already. It's 5hrs 46mins on audiobook btw.",

I think the term is a \u201csoft magic\u201d system? \n\nI\u2019d prefer a book that was light hearted over anything dramatic and heart pulling. Romance would be a big plus for me too. \n\nAny recommendations that fit that feel would be appreciated.\n\nBooks recommended:\n\n* Cackle\n* House in the Cerulean Sea\n* The Forgotten Witch\n* Keeper of Enchanted Rooms\n* Practical Magic\n* Off to be the Wizard\n* Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell\n* Stay a Spell series",

It's about a young kid who falls through a hole in his laundry room and lands in the \"underland.\" Lots of similar themes as The Hunger Games (also rec if you haven't read!)\n\nI also love the *Lunar Chronicles* by Marissa Meyer. They are scifi/dystopian retellings of fairy tales. The FMC develops a found family with a group that are all trying to uncover some conspiracies about the government and a pandemic disease. Kind of fluffy at times, but I really loved the world building and felt like it had a pretty satisfying ending.\n\n*Lockwood and Co* by Johnathan Stroud. It takes place in a dystopian/paranormal au london where ghosts have started appearing and only kids can see/hear/sense them. The kids are ghost hunting \"agents\" or sometimes just night security guards and the adults allow the kids to be put into some pretty dangerous situations for their own benefit. Lockwood and Co is the only kid/employee owned agency, and it follows the 3(+) members as they try to grow their agency and make names for themselves.",

Caetano Veloso, who some people say was like the Bob Dylan of Brazil, but in someways a lot cooler, had a memoir called Tropical something but that was really good. So yeah I mean there\u2019s lots of different types of nonfiction. \n\nI think 1491 and 1493 are fantastic. Born to run, by Christopher McDougall, nonfiction, but definitely a powerful compelling narrative. Definitely recommend the audiobook. Anti-fragile, byNassim Taleb , is pretty fun to read/listen to. Although his lectures and manner of speaking in person are awful, he\u2019s brilliant and his books:  black Swan and fooled by randomness and anti-fragile are very readable in my opinion.",
